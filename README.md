# Fibonacci Functions 

Fibonacci Series printed in various different ways using Recursion.

# Controls 

`1`: To see a specific amount of values in the series 
`2`: To see a specific amount of values in the series starting from a specific value 
`3`: To see a specific amount of values in the series from a certain range.
`4`: Find a specific fibonacci number term in the series 
`/quit`: Quits the program 


# Extras 

The program will not print the series if the inputs do not make sense. For example, if a value you want to find is not fibonacci, it will not return a number, rather a message instead. The inputs have to make logical sense. 

The program does catch many logical errors in terms of user inputs, however, may not catch all. Therefore, the user has to make sure that the inputs make sense. 

The program may be a little complex than ususal due to the effort to include recursion instead of iteration.
